Usage:
circle_detection_v11_2:
    build_detect_model.py: this file is used to build or evaluate model

    There is a set of parameter in the main function to be modified before train

    run script:
    python build_detect_model.py

    mode.py: this file contains the model structure of the CNN and the custom metric function to evaluate model during training process

    create_train_set.py: this file has function to pre-process image data and generate dataset to train model

main.py: this is the main original file include method to process data and model to evaluate model


Require package:
tensorflow==1.15
opencv==4.1.2


Train process replicate:
n_epochs = 300
img_size = 200
max_radius = 50
noise_level = 2
n_train_sample = 20000
n_test_sample = 2000
n_valid_sample = 1000
create_new_data = True
checkpoint_path = "training_1/cp.ckpt"
train_model = True
eval_model = True
save_model = False


Result:
the model result shall yield between 91-95% for prediction on the main function
